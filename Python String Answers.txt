  1.How do you concatenate two strings in Python?

By using the + operator we can concatenate two strings. A new string will be created that combines the two strings.

2.What is the difference between the + operator and the join() method for concatenating strings?

The + operator is used for concatenating a few strings. However, when you need to combine many strings, the join() method is used. The join() method is used on a string  and takes multiple number of strings as input. It joins all the strings in the sequence.

3.How do you access individual characters in a string?

To access individual characters in a string indexing can be used. Every character in a string has a numerical position, starting from 0. You use square brackets with the index number to retrieve a specific character.

4.What method is used to find the length of a string in Python?

The len() function is used to find the number of characters in a string. You use the string as an argument to the len() function, and it shows an integer representing the string's length.

5.How can you convert a string to uppercase in Python?

You convert a string to uppercase using the upper() method. This method creates and shows a new string where all lowercase characters in the original string are converted to uppercase.

6.How can you convert a string to lowercase in Python?

You convert a string to lowercase using the lower() method. This method generates and shows a new string where all uppercase characters in the original string are transformed to lowercase.

7.What method is used to replace substrings within a string?

The replace() method is used to replace occurrences of a specific substring within a string. This method takes two arguments: the substring to be replaced and the new substring that will replace it. It returns a new string with the replacements made, leaving the original string unchanged.

8.How can you split a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter?

You use the split() method to split a string into a list of substrings. This method takes a delimiter (a character or a string) as an argument. The string is split at each occurrence of the delimiter, and the resulting substrings are returned as a list. If no delimiter is provided, the string is split on space by default.

9.How do you check if a string starts with a particular substring?

You use the startswith() method to check if a string begins with a specific substring. This method takes the substring you want to check for as an argument and returns True if the string starts with that substring, and False otherwise.

10.How do you check if a string ends with a particular substring?

You use the endswith() method to check if a string ends with a specific substring. This method takes the substring you want to check for as an argument and returns True if the string ends with that substring, and False otherwise.

11.How can you remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string?

You use the strip() method to remove whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the beginning and end of a string. This method returns a new string with the leading and trailing whitespace removed, leaving the original string unchanged.

12.What method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a string?

The find() method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. It takes the substring you are searching for as an argument and returns the index of its first occurrence. If the substring is not found, the find() method returns -1.

13.How can you count the number of occurrences of a substring within a string?

The count() method is used to count the number of times a specific substring appears within a string. It takes the substring you want to count as an argument and returns an integer representing the number of non-overlapping occurrences.

14.How do you check if a string contains only alphabetic characters?

You use the isalpha() method to check if a string contains only alphabetic characters (letters). This method returns True if all characters in the string are letters (a-z, A-Z), and False otherwise.

15.How do you check if a string contains only numeric characters?

You use the isdigit() method to check if a string contains only numeric characters (digits). This method returns True if all characters in the string are digits (0-9), and False otherwise.

16.How can you check if a string is a palindrome?

To check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), you compare the original string with its reversed version. You can reverse the string using slicing. If the original string and the reversed string are equal, then the string is a palindrome.

17.How can you reverse a string in Python?

You can reverse a string using slicing with a step of -1. This creates a reversed copy of the string without modifying the original string.

18.How do you format a string with placeholders for variable values?

You can format a string with placeholders for variable values using f-strings or the format() method. f-strings allow you to embed expressions inside string literals by prefixing the string with f . The format() method uses curly braces as placeholders and then substitutes values into those placeholders.

19.How do you access a substring of a string using slicing?

You access a substring of a string using slicing. Slicing involves specifying a start index, an end index, and optionally a step. The slice start: end extracts a portion of the string from the start index up to the end index. If the start index is omitted, it defaults to the beginning of the string, and if the end index is omitted, it defaults to the end of the string.

20.How can you remove specific characters from a string in Python?

You can remove specific characters from a string by using the replace() method to replace those characters with an empty string. Alternatively, you could iterate through the string and build a new string, only including characters you want to keep.
